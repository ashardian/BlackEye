# ‚ö´ BlackEye (Modified Version) - Phishing Toolkit with Cloudflared & LAN Support

This is a modified version of the **BlackEye** phishing toolkit. The original version was limited to Ngrok and LocalTunnel for exposing the phishing server to the internet. These have been removed and replaced with:

- ‚úÖ **Cloudflared** support (secure, reliable, no warning screens)
- ‚úÖ **Localhost (LAN)** option for internal network testing
- ‚úÖ Optional support to manually SSH tunnel (e.g. via localhost.run)
- ‚ùå Ngrok/LocalTunnel fully removed (no more forced downloads or errors)

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- `php`
- `cloudflared` (for WAN tunneling)
- `bash`
- Optional: `jq`, `xsel` for link shortening or clipboard copy (not required)

Install `cloudflared`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already):
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/An0nUD4Y/blackeye.git
   cd blackeye
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x blackeye_modified.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./blackeye.sh
   ```

4. **Choose a phishing template**, e.g. Instagram, Facebook, etc.

5. **Choose the tunnel method**:
   ```
   1) Cloudflared (WAN access)
   2) Localhost (LAN only)
   ```

6. üîó The script will:
   - Launch PHP server on `localhost:3333`
   - If **Cloudflared** is chosen: Start a WAN tunnel and show the link
   - If **Localhost** is chosen: Show your LAN IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:3333`)

---

## üåê Optional: Using SSH Tunnel (like localhost.run)

If you prefer not to use Cloudflared, you can also manually run:

```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:3333 ssh.localhost.run
```

This will give you a public URL like `https://yourname.localhost.run`

---

## üß† Notes

- All Ngrok/LocalTunnel code and logic has been removed.
- The phishing pages still reside in the `sites/` directory.
- You must ensure the phishing template folder (like `instagram/`) exists before launching.
